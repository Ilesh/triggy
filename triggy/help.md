## Usage tips

It's better to setup the shot before connecting to your camera since most models will not allow you to modify camera settings after connecting.

Manual focus is recommended since the camera won't release the shutter until it gets a AF lock which can cause missed shots.

After making or receiving a phone call make sure to open the app again, otherwise iOS might terminate the task. Also keep the calls to under 10 minutes or the same thing can happen.

When using a 5D Mark IV don't enable the Live View, this is known to stop the capture.
